# This file describes the rotation of the centralized log files in /data, from

        rotate 999999
        # Rotate daily
        daily
        # Compress rotated files
        compress
        # Use the rotation date as an extension
        dateext
        # Reload rsyslog after rotation, but only once for all scripts

        # Disabled, since logrotate insists these directories exist before
        # rotation (and even before running scripts...)
        # olddir archive

# This logfile is mostly used for quick lookups of recent events and for
# logcheck to parse. So we only keep one rotated version. Logcheck should be
# able to handle the rotation gracefully this way.
